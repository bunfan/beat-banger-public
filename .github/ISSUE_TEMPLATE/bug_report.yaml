        - When reporting bugs, you'll simplify our life (and the fix will come sooner) if you follow the guidelines in this template.
        - Write a descriptive issue title above.
        - The golden rule is always to open one issue for one bug. If you notice several bugs and want to report them, make sure to create one new issue for each of them.
        - Search open and closed issues to ensure it has not already been reported. If you don't find a relevant match or are unsure, don't hesitate to open a new issue.
